Micro CSS-in-JS library.

## Disclaimer

Promptu is an on-going pet project for experimenting with CSS-in-JS styling techniques. At its current state, it is not production ready, has an ever-changing API, and lacks proper documentation. Its features are driven by internal requirements and is meant for internal use only.
